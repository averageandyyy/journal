i had initially started out trying to make my input window interactive similar to how you would interact with a terminal but it didn't work out. so i ended up using getnstr and removed the update function. sadge. the problem was with managing cursorpositions and the indexing of the input array whilst considering cursor movement with LR keys with deletes. the fact that it didnt wrap as troubling. but alls good now.
